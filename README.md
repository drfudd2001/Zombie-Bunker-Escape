# Zombie-Bunker-Escape
Zombie Bunker Escape is a Python text‑based survival game set in an underground facility overrun by zombies, featuring branching room navigation, inventory‑driven keycard and code locks, terminal interactions, and multiple fail states that highlight structured game loops, modular functions, and clear separation of narrative flow from game logic.
